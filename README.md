# Inteligent-PIR-Sensor
Intelligent Passive Infrared Sensor based on Learning Vector Quantization for Human Detection

# Overview
This repo contains the code and data for an intelligent passive infrared (iPIR) sensor that uses the Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) algorithm for human detection. The iPIR is designed to be used in smart home and building automation applications.

# Contents
The repo is organized into three main parts:
### ESP32 embedded code: 
This directory contains the source code for the iPIR, which is written in C++ and designed to run on the ESP32 microcontroller.
### Python code for model training: 
This directory contains the source code for training the LVQ model, which is written in Python and uses the scikit-learn library.
### Dataset: 
This directory contains the dataset that was used to train and evaluate the LVQ model.
